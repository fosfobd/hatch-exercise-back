## Requirements
- Docker

## Running Locally
1. You will need a `.env` file in the root folder, you probably received this along with the url of this repo :smiley.
2. Run the docker-compose command to initialize the db, this can take up to 60 seconds: `docker-compose up -d`
3. Run the webserver: `yarn dev`
